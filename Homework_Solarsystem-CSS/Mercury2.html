                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s moon. It is
                        the closest planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
                        <br> Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that
                        is covered with craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to
                        keep things simple. This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long
                        time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation.
                        <br> A year on Mercury goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very
                        long to go all the way around.
                        <br> It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Mercury, you’d
                        have a birthday every three months! A day on Mercury is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the
                        sun rises and sets each and every day. Because Mercury has a slow spin and short year, it takes a
                        long time for the sun to rise and set there.
                        <br>Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't that weird?

                        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due to its proximity it is not easily seen except during
                            twilight.
                            <br> For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until
                            1965 it was thought
                            <br> that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury can
                            be observed from the Earth
                            <br>passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit, the next will occur on the 9th
                            May 2016.
                            <br> Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. One of five planets visible with the naked
                            eye a, Mercury is just 4,879 Kilometres across its equator, compared with 12,742 Kilometres for
                            the Earth.
