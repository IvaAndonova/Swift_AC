                        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet.
                            It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes,
                            canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
                            <br> There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin
                            clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground. Scientists
                            want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could
                            support life now or in the future.
                            <br> Mars is approximately half the diameter of Earth with a surface area only slightly less than
                            the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's
                            volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange
                            appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust.[35] It can look like
                            butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending
                            on the minerals present

                                &nbsp;&nbsp; Physical characteristics The bright rust color Mars is known for is due to iron-rich minerals in its regolith â€” the loose
                                dust and rock
                                <br> covering its surface. The soil of Earth is a kind of regolith, albeit one loaded with organic
                                content.
                                <br> According to NASA, the iron minerals oxidize, or rust, causing the soil to look red. The
                                cold, thin atmosphere means liquid water likely cannot exist on the Martian surface for any
                                length of time.
                                <br> Features called recurring slope lineae may have spurts of briny water flowing on the surface,
                                but this evidence is
                                <br> disputed; some scientists argue the hydrogen spotted from orbit in this region may instead
                                indicate briny salts.
                                <br> This means that although this desert planet is just half the diameter of Earth, it has the
                                same amount of dry land.
