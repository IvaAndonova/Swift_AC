            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <h3>Our home planet provides us with life and protects us from space.</h3>
            <p>Viewing Earth from the unique perspective of space provides the opportunity to see Earth as a whole. Earth, our
                home planet, is the only planet in its solar system known to harbor life. All of the things we need to survive
                are provided under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the uninhabitable void of space.
                <br> Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable.
                <br> Air, water, land, and life—including humans—combine forces to create a constantly changing world. Various
                satellites and spacecraft, including the Mars Rover and Cassini, which hails from Saturn,
                <br> provide perspectives of the planet from the others in the solar system.
